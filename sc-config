# SPROUTCORE CONFIGURATION FILE
# Use this file to customize the URLs, source and output paths and and other
# options used by the SproutCore build system to create the output for your
# SproutCore applications.

# If you want to use the libraries provided by other gems, require those gems
# here.  SproutCore will automatically locate and load any bundles found in
# your load path.  The sproutcore gem is automatically loaded for you.
#
# require 'sproutcore'

# This configuration section will be applied to all bundles used by your
# application, even bundles that come from other gems.

  # page.

  # CSS or images in your files.

  # your preferred language .lproj if it cannot find the resource in the
  # current language.

  # provided by SproutCore, you can specifiy the path name to the index.html

  # is relative to the root of this project.
  # c[:layout] = 'lib/index.rhtml'

  # This is the fully qualified path to the directory you want all of your
  # static files stored in.  You can place any files not managed by the build
  # system here.  SproutCore will also save its cached resources here.
